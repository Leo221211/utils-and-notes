    "1. What really to device is the data. model.to(device) is actally moving the parameters to device. So for some initializations like creterion, if they don't have parameter data, they can omit the to.device (adding to.device is not wrong though). For the code (instructions, they are not device dependent and no matter cpu or gpu they use instructions on the same place (?))"
