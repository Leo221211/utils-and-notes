# ***basic built-in operations***

## 1. **system and R lang related**

1. help: `help(<method_name>)` or `?<method_name>`
1. `mode()`, `class`: details see 1a
1. `ls()` will display all the objects exist in this R session
1. `rm()` remove a existing object  
    `rm(list=ls())`: remove all
1. `options()`: configurations
    1. `options(digits=3)`: display number with 3 digits
1. `proc.time()` return the time like python `time`
1. `exists("name")`: whether exists an object called `name`
1. `traceback()`: When an error occurs, R saves information about the current stack of active functions, and traceback() prints this list. (latest on top, different with python)
    
## 2. **Very basic syntax**

1. Comments
  Use `#` to comment.
  
1. (Especially in R command line,) if want 2 commands in one line, separate with `;`

1. assignment  
    1. \<CCLD>: when you use, when doing assignment always `<-`, when calling function param, always `=`. But also remember the special case below.

    1. explanation: 
    
        1. similar to assignment of other languages. Can use symbols `=` or `<-`

        1. but R uses = for yet another purpose: associating function arguments with values. E.g.,  `f(x=3)`.   
        But can also `f(x<-3)`, and in this way after the funciton, `x` is still there since it is global.
        
        1. Technically, `<-` is a global assignment operator, `=` is a local assignment operator. But the local in the outmost environ is global.
        
    1. Other notes:  
        1. similar to C, the return value of assignment is the value it assigns

            ```
            Fibonacci[1] <- Fibonacci[2] <- 1
            ```
                
        1. But in functions, `<-` is still not "global". `<<-` is. See section 5a for details
    
  
## 3. **math and logic calculation**

1. Operations and precedence

    1. Notes:  
        1. Associativity  
        In the same row of the table (which means same priority), use associativity rules.  
        Most operators in R have associativity from left to right.  
        Exponent `^` and leftward assignment (`<-`, `=`) are from right to left.  
        eg.  
              1. `5%%3%/%2` means `(5%%3)%/%2` (left to right)  
            1. `2^3^2` means `2^(3^2)` (right to left)
        1. Inside `()` rearrange priority
        1. Unary minus means the negative sign (?)
        1. The `&` and `|` operator performs the element-wise comparison and returns a logical vector of the same length as its input.  
        `&&` and `||`: beside is 2 logical expression with value `T` or `F`.   
        1. NA involved in any calculation (math / logic) will result in NA

1. Special numbers    

    ```
    > 1/0 
    [1] Inf
    
    > 0/0 
    [1] NaN
    ```

1. Built-in math functions
    1. sqrt, abs, sin, cos, log, exp
    1. others
    
        ![](./images/Screenshot 2025-02-16 141455.png){width=50%}
        1. notes / eg use
            1. `ceiling`, `floor`, `trunc`, `round`: note, the return value is still numeric not integer
            
                ```
                > round(1.5)
                [1] 2
                > class(round(1.5))
                [1] "numeric"
                ```
            1. `round` has a paramm `digit`, indicating the number of decimal places. Default is 0
                
            1. stats functions like `mean`, `var`, `sd`: if has `NaN` inside, the result is `NaN`
                
                ```
                mean(c(NaN, 1, 2))
                [1] NaN
                ```
            1. `cumsum`: 
                
                ```
                > cumsum(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
                [1]  1  3  6 10
                ```
        
    1. other misc
    
        1. diff(v)  
            return the diff `v[i+1]-v[i]` 
            
            ```
            > diff(c(1, 2, 4))
            [1] 1 2
            ```


1. Built-in logic functions

    1. `all()` and `any()` 
        1. functions in R can be used to check if all or any values in a vector evaluate to TRUE for some expression. Return is a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
        1. Directly do eg `&&` to multi-ele vector can result in error
        
## 4. **string operations**

1. `cat`

    1. idea: just input multiple string, concatenate them together with auto coersion. No automatic space.
    
    1. eg
    
        ```
        > cat("iteration = ", 7, "\n")
        iteration =  7 
        ```

1. `paste`

    1. syntax
    
        ```
        paste (..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL, recycle0 = FALSE)
        ```
        
    1. eg
    
        ```
        > paste("Tree", 1:5)
        [1] "Tree 1" "Tree 2" "Tree 3" "Tree 4" "Tree 5"
        
        > (nth <- paste0(1:12, c("st", "nd", "rd", rep("th", 9))))
         [1] "1st"  "2nd"  "3rd"  "4th"  "5th"  "6th"  "7th"  "8th"  "9th"  "10th"
        [11] "11th" "12th"
        > month.abb
         [1] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" "May" "Jun" "Jul" "Aug" "Sep" "Oct" "Nov" "Dec"
        > paste(month.abb, "is the", nth, "month of the year.")
         [1] "Jan is the 1st month of the year."  "Feb is the 2nd month of the year." 
         [3] "Mar is the 3rd month of the year."  "Apr is the 4th month of the year." 
         [5] "May is the 5th month of the year."  "Jun is the 6th month of the year." 
         [7] "Jul is the 7th month of the year."  "Aug is the 8th month of the year." 
         [9] "Sep is the 9th month of the year."  "Oct is the 10th month of the year."
        [11] "Nov is the 11th month of the year." "Dec is the 12th month of the year."
        ```

## 4. **datatype related opereations**

1. Inspect datatype: see section 1

1. Convert datatype:
    1. Syntax: `as.<type>()`
    
        ```
        > v = c(1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 4)
        > as.numeric(v)
        [1]  1  2  3 NA NA  4
        > as.logical(v)
        [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA
        > as.character(v)   # actually originally v is of mode character
        [1] "1" "2" "3" "a" "b" "4"
        ```
    
    1. Note: can cause `NA` if not able to convert
    1. Note: can also have `as.interger()`
    
        But note:
        
        ```
        > as.integer(1.5)
        [1] 1
        ```
        
        So the way to check for integer:
        
        ```
        (input-floor(input)>0)
        ```

# ***tricky***

1. ```y<-x<2``` is actually: ```y = (x<2)```
