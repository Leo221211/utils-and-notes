# ***R basic concept***

1. indexing  
  all indexing in R is from 1 not 0  
  the slicing (eg 1:3): start and end are included

1. R language is case sensitive.

1. R operations are vector based, performs on each element of vector.

# ***datatype*** 

## **1. data type intro**
common data type: numeric, logical, character  
  
1. numeric  
    Includes both both int and float (they have different classes like `integer` or `numeric` (which is double), but the mode is all `numeric`) 
    Note: to explicitly name integer, use suffix `L`, eg `1L` means integer 1
    
1. character  
    String or character (like python), denoted by double quote `"` or single quote `'` no diff 

1. logical  
    `TRUE` and `FALSE`, can also `T` and `F`
  
## **2. Inspect data type**

1. `mode()`  
        describe the data type used for storage.  
        Only(?) have: `numeric, logical, character`, etc.
        
1. `class()`  
        describe the object class of the input variable  
        e.g., `numeric` (here numeric is "double", differen), `integer`, `list`, `matrix`, `factor`, etc.
  
1. egs

    ```
    > mode(1L); class(1L) 
    [1] "numeric" 
    [1] "integer" 
    
    > mode(factor(c("a","b"))); class(factor(c("a","b"))) 
    [1] "numeric" 
    [1] "factor" 
    
    > mode(matrix(0,2,2)); class(matrix(0,2,2)) 
    [1] "numeric" 
    [1] "matrix"
    
    # the class of basic vectors (only the numeric has a difference)
    > class(1)
    [1] "numeric"
    > class(1L)
    [1] "integer"
    > class(T)
    [1] "logical"
    > class("a")
    [1] "character"
    
    # the return class of both mode and class is "character"
    > class(mode(1))
    [1] "character"
    > class(class(1))
    [1] "character"
    
    ```

## **Special values**

### Missing value `NA` 

1. Intro
Missing values often arise in real data problems, but they can also arise because of the way calculations are performed.  

1. Inspect: `is.na()`
