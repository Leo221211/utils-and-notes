# ***R basic concept***

1. indexing  
  all indexing in R is from 1 not 0  
  the slicing (eg 1:3): start and end are included

1. R language is case sensitive.

1. R operations are vector based, performs on each element of vector.

# ***datatype*** 

## **data type intr**
  common data type: numeric, logical, character  
    1. numeric represents both int and float  
    1. character is string or character like python, denoted by double quote " or single quote no diff 
    1. logical is `TRUE` and `FALSE`, you write can also `T` and `F`
  
## **Inspect data type**
    1. `mode()`  
        describe the data type used for storage, e.g., numeric, logical, character, etc.
    1. `class()`  
        describe the object class of the input variable, e.g., numeric, integer, list, matrix, factor, etc.
    1. egs
```{R}
> mode(1L); class(1L) 
[1] "numeric" 
[1] "integer" 

> mode(factor(c("a","b"))); class(factor(c("a","b"))) 
[1] "numeric" 
[1] "factor" 

> mode(matrix(0,2,2)); class(matrix(0,2,2)) 
[1] "numeric" 
[1] "matrix"
```

## **Special values**

### Missing value `NA` 

1. Intro
Missing values often arise in real data problems, but they can also arise because of the way calculations are performed.  

1. Inspect: `is.na()`

## **Technical: storage of numbers**
